# Customer-Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques. The goal is to explore customer data to identify patterns and factors influencing churn, and to build a predictive model to improve customer retention strategies.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used for this analysis includes customer details such as demographics, service usage, and billing information. It has the following columns:
- `customerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `gender`: Gender of the customer (Male, Female).
- `SeniorCitizen`: Indicates if the customer is a senior citizen (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
- `Partner`: Indicates if the customer has a partner (Yes or No).
- `Dependents`: Indicates if the customer has dependents (Yes or No).
- `tenure`: Number of months the customer has been with the company.
- `PhoneService`: Indicates if the customer has phone service (Yes or No).
- `MultipleLines`: Indicates if the customer has multiple lines (Yes, No, No phone service).
- `InternetService`: Type of internet service the customer has (DSL, Fiber optic, No).
- `OnlineSecurity`: Indicates if the customer has online security (Yes or No).
- `OnlineBackup`: Indicates if the customer has online backup (Yes or No).
- `DeviceProtection`: Indicates if the customer has device protection (Yes or No).
- `TechSupport`: Indicates if the customer has tech support (Yes or No).
- `StreamingTV`: Indicates if the customer has streaming TV (Yes or No).
- `StreamingMovies`: Indicates if the customer has streaming movies (Yes or No).
- `Contract`: Type of contract the customer has (Month-to-month, One year, Two year).
- `PaperlessBilling`: Indicates if the customer has paperless billing (Yes or No).
- `PaymentMethod`: Payment method used by the customer (e.g., Electronic check, Mailed check, Bank transfer, Credit card).
- `MonthlyCharges`: Monthly charges incurred by the customer.
- `TotalCharges`: Total charges incurred by the customer.
- `Churn`: Indicates if the customer has churned (Yes or No).

## Installation
To run this project, you need the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- scikit-learn
- scipy

## Usage
### Load and Preprocess the Data:

- Load the dataset and handle missing values.
- Encode categorical variables.
- Normalize or standardize numerical features if necessary.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualize the distribution of features.
- Analyze relationships between features and the target variable.

## Feature Engineering:

- Create new features or modify existing ones based on insights from EDA.

## Model Building:

- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree).
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
  
## Visualization:

- Use Plotly or Matplotlib to create interactive and static visualizations.

## Model Evaluation:

- Assess model performance on the test set.
- Analyze confusion matrix, ROC curve, and other evaluation metrics.
Analysis

## Data Insights: Key findings from the data analysis, including patterns and trends influencing customer churn.
Feature Importance: Analysis of which features are most influential in predicting churn.
Model Performance: Summary of the performance of different models used, including accuracy and other metrics.

## Future Work
- Improvements: Explore advanced algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, or ensemble methods.
